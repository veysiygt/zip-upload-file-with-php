# Batch Upload Zip with PHP

In the zip upload process here, you will be able to upload all the files in the zip to the folder you want in bulk.

You can test them by throwing them on your local host.
I have specified the places you need to edit and the descriptions of the required commands on the command line.
You can use it in your projects by making a few changes.
